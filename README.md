# Personal Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my personal GitHub repository! This collection includes a variety of AI projects that I have developed during my academic studies and in collaboration with friends and colleagues. 

About This Repo

## This repo serves as a **portfolio**, which is constantly updated. It includes:

- Projects developed as part of university coursework or student research initiatives
- Collaborative side-projects with peers
- Small prototypes or explorations of technologies I was curious about

Each project folder includes:
- A short description
- Setup and usage instructions (if applicable)
- My role and contributions
- Key learnings and technologies used


Thanks for visiting!  
Feel free to explore the individual folders to learn more about what Iâ€™ve built.
